Integrating a snake game into a Godot project involves several steps, from setting up the scene to implementing the game logic. Here's a basic guide on how to create a simple snake game in Godot:

### 1. **Project Setup**
   - **Create a new Godot project**: Start Godot and create a new project.
   - **Create a new scene**: Add a new 2D scene, which will be the main game scene.

### 2. **Designing the Grid**
   - **Create a grid**: The snake game is grid-based, so create a grid to align the snake and food. You can use a `TileMap` node or manage the grid programmatically.

### 3. **Creating the Snake**
   - **Create a Snake Node**: Add a `Node2D` for the snake. 
   - **Snake Segments**: Each segment of the snake can be represented as a `Sprite` or `RectangleShape2D` node. 
   - **Movement Logic**: Implement movement by shifting each segment to the position of the previous one. The head moves in the direction indicated by user input (up, down, left, right).

### 4. **Handling Input**
   - Use the `_process(delta)` function or `_input(event)` to detect input and change the snake’s direction.
   - You can define the movement directions using a `Vector2` variable.

### 5. **Generating Food**
   - **Food Node**: Add a `Sprite` or `RectangleShape2D` for the food.
   - **Random Placement**: Use Godot’s `rand_range()` or `randi()` functions to place the food at random grid positions.

### 6. **Collision Detection**
   - **Self-Collision**: Check if the snake head’s position matches any of the body segments.
   - **Food Collision**: If the snake head’s position matches the food, grow the snake by adding a new segment.

### 7. **Game Over Logic**
   - Implement game over conditions when the snake collides with itself or the walls (if you have boundaries).

### 8. **Score and UI**
   - Add a score counter using a `Label` node.
   - Increase the score whenever the snake eats food.

### 9. **Finishing Touches**
   - Add sound effects for eating food and game over.
   - Add a restart button or automatically restart the game after a delay when the game ends.

### Example Script for Snake Movement (GDScript)
```gdscript
extends Node2D

var direction = Vector2.RIGHT
var snake_segments = []
var move_timer = 0.2
var time_since_last_move = 0

func _ready():
    # Initialize the snake with a few segments
    for i in range(3):
        add_segment(Vector2(3 - i, 3))
    
func _process(delta):
    time_since_last_move += delta
    if time_since_last_move >= move_timer:
        move_snake()
        time_since_last_move = 0

    handle_input()

func handle_input():
    if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_up") and direction != Vector2.DOWN:
        direction = Vector2.UP
    elif Input.is_action_pressed("ui_down") and direction != Vector2.UP:
        direction = Vector2.DOWN
    elif Input.is_action_pressed("ui_left") and direction != Vector2.RIGHT:
        direction = Vector2.LEFT
    elif Input.is_action_pressed("ui_right") and direction != Vector2.LEFT:
        direction = Vector2.RIGHT

func move_snake():
    # Move each segment to the position of the previous one
    for i in range(len(snake_segments) - 1, 0, -1):
        snake_segments[i].position = snake_segments[i - 1].position

    # Move the head
    snake_segments[0].position += direction * 32  # Assuming each grid cell is 32x32 pixels

func add_segment(position):
    var segment = RectangleShape2D.new()
    segment.position = position * 32  # Position in grid units
    add_child(segment)
    snake_segments.append(segment)
```

This is a very basic implementation and can be expanded with features like growing the snake when it eats food, adding obstacles, and more.
