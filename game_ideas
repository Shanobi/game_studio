# Plot

- The game will start with a blank/black screen and wait 5 minutes for either input or time expiration.
- Once input or expiration has occurred, transition to pong.
  - It will allow the control of the "ball" at first around the screen, but then it will move on its own and paddles will appear, 
    one being "highlighted" for control.
- After a "successful" rally (~10 back and forth, or ~5 mins time elapsed), transition to snake.

- Snake --> platformer
- Platformer --> "primative metal slug"

## End game?
  - A basic rpg roguelike
  - simple, a la Journey?


# After beating the "levels", the games can be unlocked for individual play.
  - i.e. pong, snake, etc.
